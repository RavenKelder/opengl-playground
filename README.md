# WebGL Rendering Engine

Browser-based OpenGL rendering engine. Renders points generated by formulas,
mostly strange attractors at the moment, with a basic fragment shader to
rotate colour. Camera controls available to translate with w, a, s, d, Shift
and Space keys; and rotate with arrow keys.

## Developement

Requires `npm` to install dependencies defined within `package.json`, and
hardware acceleration-enabled browser. Runs using Snowpack's development
server, as per the `start` script in `package.json`.
